        <p>Claud McKay was a Jamaican-American writer and poet who after moving to New York City
            would write multiple stories and poems about the discrimination in America using his unique perspective.
            He would write his own poems at the age of 10 and published his first book in 1912.
            A couple of years later Claud moved to the U.S. to go to college and immediately was shocked by the racism he encountered.
            Eventually, he would end up in New York where he would start getting politically active.
            He would approach black civil rights in a more radical way disagreeing with most mainstream 
            associations in favor of a Marxist and socialist viewpoint.
            He believed that the West prioritized business over racial justice and saw racism using a class conflict
            perspective believing economic and racial tensions would lead to a revolution.
            In his life, he would end up writing 5 novels and almost 90 pages of poetry
            with his most famous being If We Must Die.</p>
