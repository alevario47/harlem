    <div class="desc"> <p> During the 1930s and 1940s Harlem Renaissance, African American painter, 
        and printmaker Jacob Lawrence achieved fame. He was raised in Harlem in New York City 
        despite being born in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Lawrence was noted for his distinctive
         blend of realism and abstraction, which frequently featured strong geometric patterns and 
         vivid, brilliant colors. The "Migration Series," a collection of 60 panels by Lawrence that
          documents the mass movement of African Americans from the rural south to the urban north,
           is one of his most well-known pieces. The Migration Series, is regarded as one of the most
            important pieces of African American art. Another notable works by Lawrence, besides the 
            Migration Series, is "The Builders", which shows construction workers working on a building
             while black families gather and unwind in the foreground. More important than his individual
              artistic accomplishments were Lawrence's contribution to the art world. In addition to the 
              University of Washington, Pratt Institute, and Black Mountain College, he taught at several
               other universities. Although he went died in 2000, his contributions to the world of art
                have had a lasting influence on creators, art historians, and art enthusiasts.
