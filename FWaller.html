    <p>A jazz musician of the Harlem renaissance was born May 21st, 1904, in New York, and died Dec. 15th, 1943, in Kansas City of Pneumonia in a union train station at 39 years old. During his life he had two spouses, Edith Hatchet from 1920-23 and then Anita Rutherford from 1926-43. Fats stood at 6ft tall and on average 290 lbs., hence his nickname “Fats” which originated from his friends calling him that. Fats was once kidnapped by Al Capone in 1926 after leaving a performance, as Capone’s men took him and forced him to play at Al Capone’s birthday party at gunpoint, but after he said he was treated well, and given much food, snacks, and drinks and paid $100 for every song played, he partied for 3 days straight with al Capone. But the biggest influence that Fats Waller had on the Harlem Renaissance, was as a jazz pianist in the 1920s and 1930s, as he was a  really talented and really skillful player of the piano more over “Stride piano playing”. Fats in his lifetime wrote and copyrighted well over 400 songs. Lastly, although Fats was known for playing the piano, that wasn’t his limit, since he also learned the piano at age 6, but also learned and mastered the organ by 15 years old, and by 18 started his artist career, and was also a vocalist. ​</p>
