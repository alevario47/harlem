    <p>Langston Hughes was born in Joplin, Missouri, in 1901.
        One of the most influential artists from the Harlem Renaissance,
        Langston embraced the perceived imperfections of his race.
        Using dialect that many other black artists and thinkers didn't like.
        Langston chose to portray the experience of a black man including the imperfections and "ugly" side of it.
            Many other artists chose to not mention or portray those imperfections due to their feeling 
            that they had to put their "best foot" forward to get accepted by white people.
            His controversial writing style and subjects made him a very important figure in the Harlem Renaissance</p>
